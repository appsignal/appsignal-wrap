# `appsignal-wrap` changelog

  (patch [856b733](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-wrap/commit/856b7339f1b9a5cde85d41ad9bb1ffde99b27357))

## 0.2.0

_Published on 2024-11-19._

### Added

- Add command as error tag and log attribute. When reporting log lines or errors, add the command that was used to spawn the child process (or to attempt to) as a tag or attribute. (patch [90668c3](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-wrap/commit/90668c315f3736f75f99028b66e7814429064933))
- Report exit failures as errors to AppSignal. Use the `--error` command-line option to report an error to AppSignal when the command exits with a non-zero status code, or when the command fails to start:

  ```
  appsignal-wrap --error backup -- ./backup.sh
  ```

  The name given as the value to the `--error` command-line option will be used to group the errors in AppSignal.

  (patch [90668c3](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-wrap/commit/90668c315f3736f75f99028b66e7814429064933))

### Changed

- Add a required positional argument for the name. This name is used as the identifier for cron and heartbeat check-ins, the group for logs, and the action name for errors.

  This avoids repetition of command-line parameters that represent the name:

  ```sh
  # Before:
  appsignal-wrap \
    --cron backup \
    --error backup \
    --log backup \
    -- ./backup.sh

  # After:
  appsignal-wrap backup \
    --cron \
    -- ./backup.sh
  ```

  It is still possible to override the name for a specific purpose by using the `--log GROUP` and `--error ACTION` arguments, or by passing an identifier to either `--cron` or `--heartbeat`:

  ```sh
  appsignal-wrap mysql \
    --heartbeat db
    -- mysqld
  ```

  Additionally, error sending is now enabled by default (use `--no-error` to disable it) and using both cron and heartbeat check-ins in the same invocation is no longer allowed.

  (minor [90668c3](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-wrap/commit/90668c315f3736f75f99028b66e7814429064933))

## 0.1.1

_Published on 2024-11-07._

### Added

- Add `--version` command-line option. (patch [f7d2deb](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-wrap/commit/f7d2deb8033c26de93a0ac8f0ae69ac441651f06))
- Add installation script. (patch [f7d2deb](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-wrap/commit/f7d2deb8033c26de93a0ac8f0ae69ac441651f06))

### Changed

- Restore the default `SIGPIPE` behaviour as implemented by the Rust standard library, which is to ignore `SIGPIPE` signals. Unless overriden by the child process, this behaviour will be inherited by it. (patch [f7d2deb](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-wrap/commit/f7d2deb8033c26de93a0ac8f0ae69ac441651f06))
